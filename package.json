This should only match 1 related file type, if multiple can be matched then they should be defined as separate types.\n2. This will be used to evaluate files and also folder paths, so an extension should be included if possible to prevent matching folders.\n3.

The patterns are evaluated against the full path, not relative to the workspace root.\n5. The patterns are case sensitive.\n6. Paths are normalised to use \"/\".\n\nFor project structures which repeat prefix folder paths in different locations (e.g. `.../projectA/src/components/Button.ts` linking to `.../projectA/tests/components/Button.test.ts` where the `.../projectA` folder path is repeated but should not link to files in `.../projectB`), a prefix can also be captured which will be used for matching related files e.g. `(?<prefix>.*)\\\\/(test|tests)\\\\/(?<topic>.+)\\\\.test\\\\.ts$`",
