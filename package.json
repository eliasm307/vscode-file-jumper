                  "markdownDescription": "RegEx patterns (case insensitive) that should match relevant files and capture the part of the path that will be constant for sibling pattern group items (aka the topic).\n\nThis extension uses RegEx for matching file paths, instead of glob patterns, to allow for more flexibility in the rules that can be defined.\n\nThe topic capture group is defined as a group named 'topic' (for example `\\\\/(test|tests)\\\\/(?<topic>.+)\\\\.test\\\\.ts$`).\n\n**NOTES**\n\n1. This should only match 1 related file type, if multiple can be matched then they should be defined as separate types.\n2. This will be used to evaluate files and also folder paths, so an extension should be included if possible to prevent matching folders.\n3. The patterns are evaluated in the order they are defined, so more specific patterns should be defined first.\n4. The patterns are evaluated against the full path, not relative to the workspace root.\n5. The patterns and comparisons between paths are case insensitive.\n6. Paths are normalised to use \"/\".\n\nFor project structures which repeat prefix folder paths in different locations (e.g. `.../projectA/src/components/Button.ts` linking to `.../projectA/tests/components/Button.test.ts` where the `.../projectA` folder path is repeated but should not link to files in `.../projectB`), a prefix can also be captured which will be used for matching related files e.g. `(?<prefix>.*)\\\\/(test|tests)\\\\/(?<topic>.+)\\\\.test\\\\.ts$`\n\n**Patterns and Links**\n\nThe extension requires defined RegEx patterns to capture specific named groups from file paths which will be used to determine if files of different types are related. The named groups that can be matched are:\n\n- `topic`: This represents the part of the file path that is repeated for related files. For example, a file `src/components/Button.ts`, the topic could be `components/Button` which could be used to match a test file `test/components/Button.test.ts`. The example configuration below shows example file type definitions that can achieve this link.\n- `prefix`: (**OPTIONAL**) This represents the the root path and can be used to differentiate between files with a similar structure but from different root folders (e.g. a mono-repo) e.g. `packages/PackageA/src/components/Button.ts` and `packages/PackageB/test/components/Button.test.ts` would have a link if a prefix capture group is not defined. If your project does not have this structure, you can omit this capture group.\n\nMultiple patterns can be defined and these are evaluated in the given order, where the first match is used. This allows for more complex folder structures and exceptions to rules to be supported. This means more specific patterns should be defined first so they can match their specific cases before more general patterns are evaluated.\n\nThe extension will automatically link all files of different types that resolve to the same topic and prefix (if defined). You can customise which files can link to/from other files by using the `onlyLinkTo` and `onlyLinkFrom` properties.\n\nFor building Regex patterns easily try [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) which has a handy cheat sheet, live evaluation, and lets you test your patterns against multiple strings (paths) at the same time.",
