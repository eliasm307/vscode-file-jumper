# Co-Locate

Sometimes you have a project with a lot of files that are related to each other but cant be located near each other. For example, you could have a `src` directory with a lot of files and a `test` directory with the same file structure but with a different suffix. This limitation makes it hard to navigate between related files.

This extension allows you to define relationships and navigate easily between these files.
